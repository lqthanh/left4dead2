"Settings"
    BindKeyboard = 0
        0 = disable, 1 = enable & need manual bind, "<key>" = enable & auto bind
        Binding any keys on the keyboard and mouse, this mode only support single click.
        You can find some special keys' name in here: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Bind#Special_Keys
        Set the key what you want, need to be enclosed in double quotes, it is best not to use keys that are already used in the game.
        For example, I want to bind the b key: BindKeyboard = "b"
        Although the mod will bind the key automatically, but I still recommend using autoexec.cfg.
        If you only want to do it yourself, please set BindKeyboard = 1
        Then add the following to Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2/cfg/autoexec.cfg, after finished, enter exec autoexec in the console.
            setinfo cmd_inspect 0
            alias "_inspect" "setinfo cmd_inspect 1; alias _inspect _inspect2"
            alias "_inspect2" "incrementvar cmd_inspect 1 999999 1"
            bind "b" "_inspect"
        P.S. When this mode is enabled, BindButton will be disabled, but other players in the game who not set up will still be able to use it.

    BindButton = BUTTON_RELOAD
        Press the button(s) play inspect animation, again to end.
        Attack/shove/reloading/switch weapon and dominated by special infected will interrupt the animation.
        These button can be detected, for multiple buttons, use + connect them or add the numbers together.
        Button JUMP/FORWARD/BACK/USE/MOVELEFT/MOVERIGHT not work while incapacitated.
            BUTTON_JUMP = 2          // Jump (space)
            BUTTON_DUCK = 4          // Duck (ctrl)
            BUTTON_FORWARD = 8       // Forward (w)
            BUTTON_BACK = 16         // Back (s)
            BUTTON_USE = 32          // Use (e)
            BUTTON_MOVELEFT = 512    // Move Left (a)
            BUTTON_MOVERIGHT = 1024  // Move Right (d)
            BUTTON_RELOAD = 8192     // Reload (r), default set
            BUTTON_SCORE = 65536     // Scores (tab)
            BUTTON_WALK = 131072     // Walk (shift)
            BUTTON_ZOOM = 524288     // Zoom (middle mouse), bad with SG552 and Sniper

    ButtonMode = 1
        0 = close button detection, can still use command to inspect.
        1 = click
        2 = long press
        3 = click + long press

    MultiClick = 2
        Detects arbitrary press counts, set to 0 will never trigger.

    LongPressTime = 1
        Hold the button for a while.

    HideCrosshair = 1
        0/1 Hide in-game crosshair while playing animation, not work at custom crosshair.

    DisableAutoTriggers = 0
        0 = close, 1 = look item, 2 = help friend, 3 = both
        Disable automatic play the looking item and helping hand animations.

    DemoMode = 0
        0/1 Only play the inspect animations once.
        Retract animation usually has not aligned with the end of the inspect animation, so it will be a little unsmooth.

    NoShuffle = 0
        Play the animations listed in "Animations" random or order.
        0 = random，1 = order，2 = order when DemoMode enabled

    NeedlessFix = 0

"Animations"
    [1] = ["ACT_VM_ITEMPICKUP_EXTEND_LAYER", "ACT_VM_ITEMPICKUP_LOOP_LAYER", "ACT_VM_ITEMPICKUP_RETRACT_LAYER"],
    [2] = ["ACT_VM_HELPINGHAND_EXTEND_LAYER", "ACT_VM_HELPINGHAND_LOOP_LAYER", "ACT_VM_HELPINGHAND_RETRACT_LAYER"],
    Usually custom models replace these animations as inspect animations, the 1st one is looking item animations, and 2nd is helping hand animations.
    Few weapons use different names, but you don't have to worry about that as long as the model use these animations.

    And new animations
        In order to easily modify the configuration of each weapon, use 2^n(n >= 0) as the key name in the "Animations" table.
        If you want to add new animations, best use the ones with "LAYER" suffix.
        Also use "debug" command to get all animations information, and "play" to test them.
        Not force to set all animations, only one is ok.
        If you add two or number greater than two loopable animations, press button will toggle them instead end until the last one played.
        Be careful not to forget the [] and "", also the final comma.
        This is an example: [4] = ["ACT_VM_DEPLOY_LAYER", "", ""],

"Weapons"
    Set playable animations for each weapon, all available by default.
    The value is the sum of the key name in "Animations" table. 0 = empty, -1 = all animatons.
    If there are multiple animations, it is can write to 1 + 2 or plus them.
    Most of custom models may only replace the looking item animations.
    Except primary/secondary weapons, other items almost have no inspect animations replaced.
    Some custom maps have new melee weapons, you can add them to the list, weapon's name are same as the 'give' console command shows, or you can use "custom_melee_default" for all custom melee which not added.
